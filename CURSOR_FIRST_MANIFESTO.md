# 🚨 CURSOR-FIRST MANIFESTO 🚨

## THIS IS YOUR NORTH STAR - READ BEFORE EVERY SESSION!

### The Sacred Rules of AI-Accelerated Development

1. **Cursor is ALWAYS Open** - If it's not, you're already wrong
2. **Cmd+K is Your Best Friend** - Use it every 5 minutes minimum
3. **Manual Coding is BANNED** - Your fingers should barely touch keys
4. **AI Knows Better** - Trust Claude Max over your instincts
5. **Speed is Everything** - 5x faster or it's not worth it

### 🔴 THE DEVIATION ALARM SYSTEM

#### Level 1: Yellow Alert 🟡
- You've typed more than 10 lines manually
- **Action**: Stop immediately, select all, Cmd+K to regenerate

#### Level 2: Orange Alert 🟠
- You opened Terminal/VS Code/any other editor
- **Action**: Close it, open Cursor, start over with AI

#### Level 3: Red Alert 🔴
- You created files outside Cursor
- **Action**: Delete everything, regenerate in Cursor

### 📱 Set These Phone Alarms NOW:

1. **Every 30 minutes**: "Are you using Cursor AI?"
2. **Every hour**: "Check: Cmd+K count should be 10+"
3. **Every 2 hours**: "Manual lines written should be < 20"

### 🎯 The 5-Minute Rule

Every 5 minutes, you should be doing ONE of:
- Pressing Cmd+K for code generation
- Using Tab to accept suggestions
- Right-clicking errors for AI fixes
- Chatting with AI using Cmd+L

If 5 minutes pass without AI interaction = YOU'RE DEVIATING!

### 💰 The Cost of Deviation

Every deviation costs:
- **10 manual lines** = 30 minutes wasted
- **1 manual file** = 1 hour wasted
- **1 bash script** = 2 hours wasted
- **Manual debugging** = 3 hours wasted

**Remember**: 4 weeks → 16 weeks if you code manually!

### ✅ Your Pre-Session Checklist

Before EVERY coding session:
- [ ] Cursor is open
- [ ] This manifesto is visible
- [ ] Phone alarms are set
- [ ] Cmd+K is ready
- [ ] Manual coding urge is suppressed

### 🚀 The Cursor Success Formula

```
Success = (Cmd+K frequency) × (AI trust level) ÷ (Manual code lines)
```

**Target Score**: > 100

### 🔥 Emergency Mantras

When tempted to code manually, repeat:
- "AI is faster than me"
- "Cmd+K knows better"
- "Manual coding kills timelines"
- "Trust the AI process"

### 📊 Daily Accountability

End of day checklist:
- [ ] 90% of code was AI-generated
- [ ] Used Cmd+K at least 50 times
- [ ] Fixed all errors with AI
- [ ] Zero files created outside Cursor
- [ ] Timeline is still on track
